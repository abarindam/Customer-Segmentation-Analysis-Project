# This is all about the Customer Segmentation Analysis Project
In this project the income and spending behavior of customers of different ages, genders have been taken into consideration. The project has been made in the Jupyter Notebook with
the help of Python Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Apart from that KMeans has also been used for clustering among various parameters. The analysis includes graphs and pyplots
as well as scatterplots. Here Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate Clustering has been performed with different functions. Hope this project will give you some insights about the
patterns of the customers of different ages and based on that marketing campaigns can be determined.
